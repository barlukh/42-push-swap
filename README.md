# 42 - Push_swap

## About
Push_swap is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum. This project focuses on sorting data in a stack using a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the lowest possible number of actions.
Checker program checks whether the list of instructions actually sorts the stack properly. My impementation of push_swap is built around the 'best-friend' approach.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
