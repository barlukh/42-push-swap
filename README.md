# 42 - Push_swap

## About
Push_swap is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum. This project focuses on sorting data in a stack using a limited set of instructions, aiming to achieve the lowest possible number of actions.
Bonus task for this project involves writing our own checker program, which replicates the behaviour of the program provided by the school. Checker program checks whether the list of instructions actually sorts the stack properly.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
